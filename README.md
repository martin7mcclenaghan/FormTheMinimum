#Form the Minimum Challenge from Code Wars

So this is my solution to the 'Form the Minimum' challenge from Code Wars created by MrZizoScream.

Code wars is great if you are learning to program like me! https://www.codewars.com/

The challenge is to take an array of integers and return the smallest integer that can be created from unique
numbers from the array.
